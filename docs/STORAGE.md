# LiteGraph Storage Configuration

LiteGraph uses provider-neutral database settings while keeping SQLite as the default zero-configuration backend.

The current implementation supports SQLite execution through the repository factory and includes an executable PostgreSQL provider backed by `NpgsqlDataSource`.

## Defaults

Default database settings:

```json
{
  "LiteGraph": {
    "Database": {
      "Type": "Sqlite",
      "Filename": "litegraph.db",
      "InMemory": false,
      "Hostname": "localhost",
      "Port": null,
      "DatabaseName": "litegraph",
      "Username": null,
      "Password": null,
      "Schema": "litegraph",
      "ConnectionString": null,
      "MaxConnections": 32,
      "CommandTimeoutSeconds": 30
    }
  }
}
```

The legacy `LiteGraph.GraphRepositoryFilename` setting is still supported. Setting it updates the SQLite filename in `LiteGraph.Database.Filename`.

## Storage And Vector Search Pairings (v10.0)

Each provider comes with its own vector search, and the pairing decides how LiteGraph can be deployed:

| Provider | Vector storage | Vector index | Deployment |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite | raw float32 bytes in `vectors.embeddings` | HnswLite, in the server process (`HnswRam` in memory, `HnswSqlite` persisted to a file) | one process |
| PostgreSQL | pgvector `vector` column `vectors.embeddings` | pgvector HNSW index inside the database | one node or a cluster of many |

SQLite keeps vectors next to the data and indexes them in memory, which suits embedded use and single servers; after a restart an in-memory index is rebuilt from the database the first time it is used. PostgreSQL keeps the index in the database itself, so it is always consistent with the stored vectors and every node of a cluster searches the same index. See [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md).

## SQLite

SQLite is the default backend:

```json
{
  "LiteGraph": {
    "Database": {
      "Type": "Sqlite",
      "Filename": "litegraph.db",
      "InMemory": false
    }
  }
}
```

For a temporary in-memory repository:

```json
{
  "LiteGraph": {
    "Database": {
      "Type": "Sqlite",
      "Filename": "litegraph.db",
      "InMemory": true
    }
  }
}
```

SQLite is appropriate for local development, tests, embedded deployments, and small single-process deployments.

## Environment Variables

Server startup applies these environment variables after reading `litegraph.json`:

| Variable | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_TYPE` | `LiteGraph.Database.Type` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB` | `LiteGraph.GraphRepositoryFilename` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_FILENAME` | `LiteGraph.GraphRepositoryFilename` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_HOST` | `LiteGraph.Database.Hostname` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_PORT` | `LiteGraph.Database.Port` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_NAME` | `LiteGraph.Database.DatabaseName` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_USERNAME` | `LiteGraph.Database.Username` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_PASSWORD` | `LiteGraph.Database.Password` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_SCHEMA` | `LiteGraph.Database.Schema` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` | `LiteGraph.Database.ConnectionString` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `LiteGraph.Database.MaxConnections` |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `LiteGraph.Database.CommandTimeoutSeconds` |
| `LITEGRAPH_TRANSACTION_MAX_OPERATIONS` | `LiteGraph.Transactions.MaxOperations` |
| `LITEGRAPH_TRANSACTION_MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `LiteGraph.Transactions.MaxTimeoutSeconds` |

`LITEGRAPH_DB` and `LITEGRAPH_DB_FILENAME` are aliases for the SQLite filename. `LITEGRAPH_DB` takes precedence when both are set.

## Provider Selection

Embedded callers can create repositories through `GraphRepositoryFactory`:

```csharp
using LiteGraph;
using LiteGraph.GraphRepositories;

DatabaseSettings settings = new DatabaseSettings
{
    Type = DatabaseTypeEnum.Sqlite,
    Filename = "litegraph.db"
};

using GraphRepositoryBase repository = GraphRepositoryFactory.Create(settings);
using LiteGraphClient client = new LiteGraphClient(repository);

client.InitializeRepository();
```

The factory returns `SqliteGraphRepository` for `DatabaseTypeEnum.Sqlite` and `PostgresqlGraphRepository` for `DatabaseTypeEnum.Postgresql`.

The embedded C# SDK surface uses the same public storage model. `DatabaseSettings`, `DatabaseTypeEnum`, and `GraphRepositoryFactory` are the supported storage configuration API for in-process callers. There is no separate storage-admin REST model in this release because the running server's provider is selected at startup and is not mutable through an authenticated admin route.

## PostgreSQL Target Configuration

PostgreSQL is the recommended production backend. Since v10.0 it requires the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension (0.8 or later recommended, for filtered index scans). Repository initialization runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`, which succeeds when the LiteGraph role owns the database or is a superuser; otherwise the server stops with a message naming the database, and an administrator runs `CREATE EXTENSION vector;` in it once. Managed services (Amazon RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL) offer pgvector; the Docker deployments use `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg17-trixie`. The configuration shape is:

```json
{
  "LiteGraph": {
    "Database": {
      "Type": "Postgresql",
      "Hostname": "postgres.example.internal",
      "Port": 5432,
      "DatabaseName": "litegraph",
      "Username": "litegraph",
      "Password": "use-a-secret-manager",
      "Schema": "litegraph",
      "MaxConnections": 32,
      "CommandTimeoutSeconds": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Or with a connection string:

```json
{
  "LiteGraph": {
    "Database": {
      "Type": "Postgresql",
      "ConnectionString": "Host=postgres.example.internal;Port=5432;Database=litegraph;Username=litegraph;Password=..."
    }
  }
}
```

Use a dedicated PostgreSQL database and schema for LiteGraph. Before production deployment, run the PostgreSQL provider suite by setting `LITEGRAPH_TEST_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING` against a disposable test database.

PostgreSQL supports:

- schema creation and indexes in the configured schema
- tenants, users, credentials, graphs, nodes, edges, labels, tags, vectors, request history, authorization audit, authorization roles, batch, vector index metadata, and admin repository methods
- graph-scoped transactions
- JSON data filters through PostgreSQL `jsonb` extraction, including numeric and boolean comparisons
- pooled concurrent writes through `NpgsqlDataSource`
- synchronous and asynchronous repository initialization/disposal
- vector storage in a pgvector column and vector search in SQL, using a cosine HNSW index per vector dimensionality (`idx_vectors_hnsw_cosine_<dimensions>`), created when a graph enables indexing and maintained by PostgreSQL on every write; dimensionalities above 2,000 use `halfvec`, and above 4,000 search is exact
- tracked schema migrations in a `schemamigrations` table (v10.0: pgvector conversion of existing embeddings, unique built-in role names, unique chat turn sequences), run under the schema lock so nodes starting together migrate once

### Docker Compose PostgreSQL Defaults

The single-node PostgreSQL deployment in `docker/single-node-postgresql/compose.yaml` starts a `postgresql` service (`pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg17-trixie`), runs a one-shot `litegraph-init` service, and injects the matching LiteGraph settings into the init and server containers with `LITEGRAPH_DB_*` environment variables. The multi-node deployment in `docker/multi-node/` uses separate `litegraph` and `clutch` roles and databases; see [`docker/README.md`](../docker/README.md).

Default local Docker values:

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Host PostgreSQL port | `15432` |
| Compose PostgreSQL host | `postgresql` |
| Database | `litegraph` |
| Username | `litegraph` |
| Password | `litegraph` |
| Schema | `litegraph` |
| Data volume | `litegraph_postgresql-data` (override with `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_VOLUME`) |

Startup order:

1. `postgresql` starts and creates the configured database from `POSTGRES_DB` when the volume is new, then `postgresql/init/01-litegraph.sh` creates the pgvector extension.
2. `litegraph-init` waits for PostgreSQL health, runs `LiteGraph.Server --init-only`, creates the configured schema and tables through the repository setup path, seeds built-in authorization roles, creates `default@user.com` / `password` and bearer token `default`, and creates a starter graph with nodes and edges when the default graph is empty.
3. `litegraph` starts only after the init service exits successfully.
4. MCP, dashboard, Prometheus, and Grafana wait on the long-running LiteGraph service.

Override sample Docker values with:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_HOST_PORT` | Host port published for PostgreSQL |
| `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` | PostgreSQL username |
| `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `LITEGRAPH_POSTGRESQL_SCHEMA` | LiteGraph schema inside the database |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | LiteGraph PostgreSQL pool size |
| `LITEGRAPH_DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | LiteGraph database command timeout |

The mounted `docker/single-node-postgresql/litegraph.json` and its `factory/` copy use `Type = Postgresql`, `Hostname = postgresql`, and the sample credentials, so a factory reset preserves the PostgreSQL-backed deployment. For SQLite, use `docker/single-node-sqlite/` instead.

### PostgreSQL Production Hardening

Use this checklist before promoting PostgreSQL-backed LiteGraph to production:

1. Create a dedicated database, schema, and database user for LiteGraph. The LiteGraph user needs ownership of the configured schema so repository initialization can create and update tables and indexes.
2. Store `LITEGRAPH_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` or `LITEGRAPH_DB_PASSWORD` in a secret manager. Do not place passwords in source-controlled `litegraph.json` files.
3. Require TLS for networked PostgreSQL traffic when LiteGraph and PostgreSQL do not run on the same trusted host or private network.
4. Set `LITEGRAPH_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` below the PostgreSQL server's available connection budget after accounting for other applications, migrations, monitoring, and administrative sessions.
5. Tune `LITEGRAPH_DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for expected graph query and transaction workloads. Keep the server `Settings.RequestTimeoutSeconds` greater than or equal to the database command timeout unless a shorter HTTP timeout is intentional.
6. Tune `LITEGRAPH_TRANSACTION_MAX_OPERATIONS` and `LITEGRAPH_TRANSACTION_MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for the largest graph transaction workload the server should accept. REST transaction requests are capped by these values before execution.
7. Run `dotnet run --project src/Test.Automated/Test.Automated.csproj --framework net10.0` with `LITEGRAPH_TEST_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING` pointed at a disposable PostgreSQL database during release validation.
8. Enable regular PostgreSQL backups and test restore into a disposable database before switching production traffic.
9. Monitor `/metrics` for `litegraph_storage_backend_info`, repository operation counts, repository operation durations, HTTP errors, graph query errors, transaction rollbacks, and `litegraph.vector.index.mutation.failures`.
10. Keep PostgreSQL autovacuum enabled. Schedule `VACUUM ANALYZE` according to write volume if operational monitoring shows bloat or stale plans.
11. Rebuild file-backed vector indexes after restoring or migrating database content if vector index files were not restored with the database.
12. For high-availability deployments, place LiteGraph behind a process supervisor or orchestrator and use PostgreSQL-managed failover. LiteGraph does not implement database failover orchestration itself.
13. Re-run provider verification after PostgreSQL major-version upgrades, schema migrations, or connection-string changes.

## Provider Test Suites

SQLite tests run by default. The PostgreSQL provider suite is registered in `Test.Shared` but skips unless a dedicated test database is configured through an environment variable:

- `LITEGRAPH_TEST_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING`

This value is intentionally a connection string so test runners do not need to print or assemble credentials. When the variable is absent, the test is reported as skipped with a reason. When the PostgreSQL variable is present, the suite initializes PostgreSQL storage and runs a live provider smoke covering core CRUD, JSON data filtering, concurrent writes, and graph transaction commit/rollback.

## Logging Safety

`DatabaseSettings.ToSafeString()` redacts:

- `Password`
- `ConnectionString`

Do not log raw settings objects or connection strings from application code.

## Migration

LiteGraph includes provider-neutral migration and verification helpers in `LiteGraph.Storage.StorageMigrationManager`.

Example SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration:

```csharp
using LiteGraph;
using LiteGraph.Storage;

DatabaseSettings source = new DatabaseSettings
{
    Type = DatabaseTypeEnum.Sqlite,
    Filename = "litegraph.db"
};

DatabaseSettings destination = new DatabaseSettings
{
    Type = DatabaseTypeEnum.Postgresql,
    ConnectionString = "Host=postgres.example.internal;Port=5432;Database=litegraph;Username=litegraph;Password=..."
};

StorageMigrationResult result = await StorageMigrationManager.MigrateAsync(
    source,
    destination,
    verify: true,
    sampleSize: 25);

if (!result.Succeeded)
{
    foreach (string difference in result.Verification.Differences)
        Console.WriteLine(difference);
}
```

The migration path copies tenants, users, credentials, graphs, nodes, edges, labels, tags, vectors, custom authorization roles, user role assignments, and credential scope assignments. Destination repositories are initialized before import, so PostgreSQL built-in roles are seeded and source built-in role references are mapped to destination built-in roles by name.

Verification compares entity counts and sampled source GUIDs in the destination. The recommended production sequence is:

1. stop writes to the SQLite deployment
2. run `StorageMigrationManager.MigrateAsync` from SQLite to PostgreSQL with verification enabled
3. review `StorageMigrationResult.Verification.Differences`
4. start LiteGraph with `Database.Type = Postgresql`
5. rebuild vector indexes if the deployment uses file-backed vector indexes and the index files were not copied with the database

## File-Backed Vector Index Artifacts (SQLite)

This section applies to SQLite. On PostgreSQL the vector index is a pgvector index inside the database, so there are no index files, and backups and restores of the database include it.

LiteGraph v7.0 uses `HnswLite` `2.0.1` for HNSW vector indexes. `HnswSqlite` index artifacts written by v7.0 include `FormatVersion = 2`, `HnswLiteVersion = "2.0.1"`, vector metadata, layer assignments, and persisted neighbor connections. The neighbor connection data is required for reload-safe indexed search after process restart.

When migrating storage providers, restoring backups, or upgrading from earlier LiteGraph builds, treat file-backed HNSW index files as derived artifacts. Back up `indexes/`, but prefer rebuilding indexes from persisted vectors unless the artifact is known to be v7.0 format. If an existing index file lacks `FormatVersion = 2`, rebuild it with `client.Graph.RebuildVectorIndex(...)`, `client.VectorIndex.RebuildVectorIndex(...)`, or `POST /v2.0/tenants/{tenantGuid}/graphs/{graphGuid}/vectorindex/rebuild` before relying on indexed search results.

## Portable Per-Graph Backup

The `Admin.Backup` path snapshots the whole database as a single binary artifact, which is the right tool for a full-instance restore but ties the copy to a provider and a point in time across every graph at once. When you need to move or archive one graph on its own, `GET /v1.0/tenants/{tenantGuid}/graphs/{graphGuid}/export/jsonl` writes that graph as newline-delimited JSON that any process can read, diff, or store in version control. Because the format carries the graph, its nodes, and its edges as plain records rather than SQLite or PostgreSQL internals, a JSONL file exported from one provider imports cleanly into the other, and a restore into an empty database with the `preserve` GUID strategy reproduces the original GUIDs. Treat it as the portable complement to the binary backup: reach for `Admin.Backup` for instance-level disaster recovery, and for JSONL when the unit of work is a single graph. See the [REST API](REST_API.md) for the export and import contract.

## Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery Runbook

On PostgreSQL, back up and restore with PostgreSQL's own tools (`pg_dump` and `pg_restore`, or volume snapshots). The pgvector index is part of the database, so nothing needs rebuilding after a restore, and the LiteGraph backup API returns an error for PostgreSQL. The rest of this runbook applies to SQLite.

`Admin.Backup` (and `POST /v1.0/backups`) snapshots the database with SQLite `VACUUM INTO`, which copies **only the main database file** — tenants, users, credentials, graphs, nodes, edges, labels, tags, and the raw stored vectors. It does **not** copy file-backed HNSW vector index artifacts (`Graph.VectorIndexFile` and its `.layers` companion for `HnswSqlite`, or the persisted snapshot for `HnswRam`), which live outside the database under `indexes/`. The same is true of a provider migration that copies only the database.

Because the index is a **derived artifact**, a restore or migration that brings back the database but not a matching, current index leaves indexed search in a degraded state that does not announce itself:

- **Missing index after restore** — vector search falls back to a brute-force linear scan. Results are still correct, but the sub-100ms indexed search you provisioned for becomes a full scan over every vector, which can silently blow past latency budgets under load.
- **Stale index** (an index file captured at an earlier point than the database) — search answers against the older vector set and can silently omit vectors added since the index was captured, with no error.

Treat the vector index rebuild as a **required, timed step** of any restore or migration. Recommended sequence:

1. Restore the database backup (or complete the provider migration) and start LiteGraph.
2. For every graph whose `VectorIndexType` is not `None` (i.e., `HnswRam` or `HnswSqlite`), rebuild the index from the persisted vectors:
   - REST: `POST /v1.0/tenants/{tenantGuid}/graphs/{graphGuid}/vectorindex/rebuild` (also available at `/v2.0/...`)
   - C# SDK: `client.Graph.RebuildVectorIndex(tenantGuid, graphGuid)` or `client.VectorIndex.RebuildVectorIndex(tenantGuid, graphGuid)`
   - MCP: `graph_rebuildvectorindex`
   Enumerate the graphs to rebuild by listing each tenant's graphs and selecting those with `VectorIndexType != None`.
3. Only rely on indexed search results after the rebuild completes for every indexed graph.

**Budget the rebuild in your RTO.** Rebuild cost scales with the number of stored vectors (and their dimensionality), so measure it against production-representative data rather than assuming it is instant. Time a rebuild of your largest indexed graph — wrap the `RebuildVectorIndex` call in a stopwatch, or measure the wall-clock of the REST call — and record that duration in the DR runbook so an operator can plan the recovery window. Until the rebuild finishes, indexed search is degraded as described above, so the rebuild time is part of the real recovery-time objective, not an afterthought.

If you must avoid a rebuild, back up the `indexes/` directory together with the database and restore both atomically so the index stays consistent with the vectors — but rebuilding from the database is the safer default, since it cannot produce a stale index. See also [File-Backed Vector Index Artifacts](#file-backed-vector-index-artifacts) for the on-disk format and version-compatibility rules.

## Current Limits

- SQLite and PostgreSQL are implemented providers. Only PostgreSQL supports more than one server process (see [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)).
- Provider-specific query generation is normalized for SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- Provider-neutral migration copies repository data but does not perform online dual-write cutover or external backup orchestration.
- PostgreSQL provider coverage runs through the live provider suite when `LITEGRAPH_TEST_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING` is configured.
